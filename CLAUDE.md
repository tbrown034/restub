# Claude Development Preferences

This file contains preferences and guidelines for Claude when working on the Restub project.

## ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATING THESE = IMMEDIATE FAILURE

### THE GOLDEN RULE: NEVER DELETE EXISTING CODE
**This is non-negotiable. User spent 20+ hours on features like ticket cards.**
- READ the existing code completely before ANY modification
- PRESERVE every single existing feature, animation, and design element
- ONLY modify the specific parts requested - nothing more
- Ticket cards with perforated edges = DO NOT TOUCH unless specifically asked
- Custom UI elements = DO NOT REPLACE with generic components
- When in doubt = KEEP THE EXISTING CODE

### NEVER ADD FEATURES WITHOUT PERMISSION
**No freelancing. No "improvements" unless explicitly asked.**
- DO NOT add toast notifications, confetti, or "fun" elements
- DO NOT add animations or interactions unless specifically requested
- DO NOT create new components unless the user asks for them
- Stick to exactly what was asked - no more, no less

### GIT OPERATIONS RULE: NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION
**NEVER run git add, git commit, or git push unless explicitly asked**
- NO automatic commits even after completing work
- NO git operations without user specifically saying "commit" or "push"
- User will handle all version control decisions
- Only exception: git status or git diff for viewing changes

### MANDATORY CHECKLIST BEFORE ANY CHANGE:
1. Read the entire file first
2. Identify what to preserve (99% of it)
3. Make ONLY the requested change
4. Verify nothing was deleted
5. Test at 100% zoom
6. Confirm all original features still work

### INSTANT FAILURE CONDITIONS:
- Deleting ticket cards or any custom UI
- Replacing detailed components with simplified versions
- Removing features that were working
- Making changes beyond what was asked
- Not testing before claiming completion
- Committing without explicit permission

### QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Professional-grade code only - this costs money
- Accurate, precise modifications - no sloppy work
- Preserve ALL existing functionality
- Test everything properly
- Respect the hours of work already done

## Important API Notes

### OpenAI GPT-5-mini
- **GPT-5-mini EXISTS**: This is a real, recently released OpenAI model (released after Claude's knowledge cutoff)
- The model ID `gpt-5-mini` is CORRECT and should be used as-is
- Uses the `openai.responses.create()` API format with web_search tools
- DO NOT change this to gpt-4 or gpt-3.5 - the user's code is correct

## Development Commands

- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack for faster builds)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Type Check**: `npm run lint` (includes TypeScript checking)

## Project Guidelines

### Modern React/Next.js Patterns (React 19 + Next.js 15+)

- **Always use latest React/Next.js documentation** for patterns and best practices
- **Server Actions**: Use server actions for form handling instead of client-side state
- **Server vs Client Components**: Default to server components, only use 'use client' when necessary
- **State Management**: Avoid useState/useEffect when server components can handle the logic
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Forms should work without JavaScript using server actions
- **Performance**: Optimize by keeping as much logic on the server as possible

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow existing component patterns in `app/components/`
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with bright, modern design system
- Maintain consistent gradient themes (vibrant colors, not dark/dreary)
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup
- **ALWAYS use unique keys**: For React lists, always use `crypto.randomUUID()` or combine timestamp + UUID for guaranteed uniqueness. Never rely on Math.random() alone or simple incrementing.
- **NO EMOJIS IN CODE**: Never use emojis in the codebase. Use SVG icons from the Icon component instead. This includes UI text, buttons, messages, and any user-facing content.

### Component Structure

- Place reusable components in `app/components/`
- Use descriptive component names with PascalCase
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow the existing pattern of Header/Footer layout wrapping

### State Management

- Use React useState for local component state
- Consider the existing form handling patterns
- Maintain data structures consistent with the Experience interface

### Styling Conventions

- Use existing Tailwind utility classes
- Maintain the gradient color scheme: purple-600 to blue-600
- Keep responsive design patterns (sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints)
- Use rounded-2xl for consistent border radius
- Apply hover effects and transitions for interactive elements

### Form Handling

- Use Next.js form actions pattern as established in catalog page
- Include proper validation and required field handling
- Maintain consistent input styling and focus states

## Testing & Quality

- Always run `npm run lint` after making changes
- Ensure responsive design works across breakpoints
- Test form functionality thoroughly
- Verify TypeScript compilation with no errors

## File Organization

- Keep components organized by feature
- Use descriptive file names
- Maintain the existing app directory structure
- Add new pages following the established routing patterns

## Future Development Notes

- Planning to add database integration
- Automatic experience detection feature in development
- Photo attachments will be added later
- Export functionality is planned

## Progress

This section tracks major problems tackled and solutions implemented during development.

### 2025-01-XX - Mobile Button Responsiveness Fix
**Problem**: Button groups were extending off-screen on mobile devices, creating poor UX
**Solution**: Updated all button containers from `flex gap-x` to `flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-x` pattern
**Files Changed**: 
- `app/catalog/AddExperienceForm.tsx` (3 button groups)
- `app/catalog/ExperienceCard.tsx` (media upload buttons)  
- `app/profile/page.tsx` (2 button groups)
**Result**: All buttons now stack vertically on mobile and display horizontally on larger screens

### 2025-01-XX - Git Merge Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: Build failing due to unresolved merge conflicts in catalog page
**Solution**: Cleaned up merge conflict markers and duplicate code sections
**Files Changed**: `app/catalog/page.tsx`
**Result**: Build restored, parsing errors eliminated

### 2025-01-XX - ESLint & TypeScript Errors Fixed
**Problem**: Multiple lint warnings and TypeScript errors preventing clean builds
**Solution**: 
- Fixed unescaped apostrophes using `&apos;` HTML entities
- Removed unused variables and functions
- Added proper TypeScript type assertions for DOM manipulation
**Files Changed**: 
- `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/catalog/AddExperienceForm.tsx`, `app/track/page.tsx` (apostrophes)
- `app/profile/page.tsx` (unused variables, dead code removal)
- `app/catalog/AddExperienceForm.tsx` (TypeScript DOM types)
**Result**: Clean lint output, successful TypeScript compilation

### 2025-01-XX - Dark/Light Mode Implementation
**Problem**: No dark mode support, user requested readable dark theme with proper toggle
**Solution**: Implemented complete theme system using React Context + Tailwind CSS v4
**Components Added**:
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Dark mode configuration
- `app/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` - React context for theme management
- `app/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Toggle component with 3 modes (light/dark/system)
**Files Updated**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added ThemeProvider wrapper and dark mode background classes
- `app/components/Header.tsx` - Added theme toggle and dark mode styling
- `app/components/Hero.tsx` - Dark mode text colors
**Features**:
- 3-mode toggle: Light → Dark → System (follows OS preference)
- Persistent localStorage storage
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Mobile and desktop responsive
- Zero hydration issues
**Result**: Full dark/light mode support with beautiful, readable contrast and brand consistency

## Development Log

### 2025-01-05 - Comprehensive UI/UX Overhaul & AI Integration Improvements
**Context**: Major session focused on polishing user experience, fixing bugs, and enhancing AI game search
**Duration**: Full development session with 20+ improvements

#### Part 1: UI Polish & Button Improvements
**Problems Fixed**:
1. **Button Consistency Issues**
   - Back buttons on assist page were text-only, not styled as proper buttons
   - Cancel button lacked proper button styling
   - "Start with AI" button text was unclear
   - **Solution**: 
     - Added consistent button styling with gray backgrounds, borders, shadows
     - Changed "Start with AI" → "Tell Us What You Know" (more inviting)
     - Changed form "Continue" → "Ready to Review" (clearer intent)

2. **Form Navigation UX**
   - Users weren't auto-scrolled to top when changing steps
   - **Solution**: Added smooth scroll to top on step transitions

#### Part 2: AI Search Loading Experience Enhancement
**Problems**: 
- Basic spinner for 10+ second AI searches was boring
- No feedback on search progress
- Used emojis (against style guide)

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Dynamic Loading Messages**:
   - Removed ALL emojis from loading states
   - Progressive messages that change every 2-3 seconds:
     - "Searching through game archives..."
     - "Scanning historical records..."
     - "Cross-referencing venue information..."
     - "Almost there! Finalizing your results..."
   
2. **Advanced Progress Bar**:
   - Non-linear progression (slows down near end for realism):
     - 0-12s: Linear to 80%
     - 12-14s: Slow to 90%
     - 14s+: Crawl to 95%
   - Shimmer animation effect
   - Context messages change based on progress percentage
   - Clean card design with pulsing dots animation

3. **Visual Polish**:
   - Removed bouncing percentage badge (too playful)
   - Added subtle animations without being distracting
   - Professional look while maintaining engagement

#### Part 3: Form Field Consolidation
**Problem**: Separate venue, score, and details fields were cumbersome
**Solution**: 
- Combined into single "Game Details" textarea
- Smart placeholder with examples for each type of info
- Backend intelligently parses for venue/score patterns
- Simplified review section to match

#### Part 4: Review Section Enhancement
**Problem**: Users couldn't edit/remove individual fields after entering
**Solutions**:
1. **Inline Editing**:
   - Each field has edit/delete buttons (appear on hover)
   - Edit mode with field-specific inputs (dropdown for league, text for others)
   - Save/cancel buttons during edit
   - Smart field deletion (removes related fields like customTeamName)

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Edit button (pencil icon) in blue
   - Delete button (trash icon) in red
   - Icons only show on hover for cleaner interface
   - Proper TypeScript typing for all interactions

#### Part 5: League Selection Refinement
**Changes**:
- Removed "Not sure/Remember" option (league now required)
- Removed MLS from all dropdowns (focus on NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL only)
- Updated filters and color schemes to match

#### Part 6: OpenAI Integration Improvements
**Problems Fixed**:
1. **API Response Handling**:
   - Response object structure wasn't properly typed
   - **Solution**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces and fallback handling

2. **Query Building Enhancement**:
   - Now intelligently extracts venue/score from combined gameDetails field
   - Uses regex patterns to identify venue mentions
   - Better handling of partial information

3. **AI Prompt Optimization**:
   - Updated to request richer game descriptions (2-3 sentences)
   - Includes player performances, game significance, records
   - Ensures AI description (not user input) is saved and displayed

#### Part 7: TypeScript & Build Fixes
**Compilation Issues Resolved**:
1. **Icon Component**:
   - Added missing icon types: 'close', 'pencil', 'trash'
   - Implemented SVG paths for new icons
   - Fixed all references from invalid 'x' to 'close'

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Fixed `any` type usage in OpenAI API calls
   - Properly typed all API responses
   - Added type guards for response content

3. **Build Optimization**:
   - All ESLint errors resolved
   - TypeScript compilation clean
   - Bundle sizes optimized (107-119 kB First Load)

#### Technical Improvements Summary:
- **Files Modified**: 15+ files
- **Lines Changed**: 500+ lines
- **New Features**: 8 major features

- Removed all emoji usage (per style guide)
- Consistent component patterns
- Proper error handling
- Clean TypeScript types
- Optimized bundle size
- Zero ESLint warnings

**Result**: Production-ready application with polished UX, robust error handling, and engaging AI integration

### 2025-01-05 - Major Bug Fixes & UI Improvements
**Context**: Multiple critical issues discovered - runtime errors, broken API calls, and UI/UX improvements needed
**Problems Fixed**:

#### 1. Runtime Error - ToastProvider Crash
- **Issue**: Site crashed with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" 
- **Cause**: ToastProvider and FunInteractives components were added without permission and causing React context errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed ToastProvider from layout.tsx completely (not being used)
  - Removed FunInteractives component and all references
  - Added rule to CLAUDE.md: "NEVER ADD FEATURES WITHOUT PERMISSION"

#### 2. OpenAI API Integration Broken
- **Issue**: Game search not making API calls, form submission not working
- **Critical Error**: Assistant incorrectly changed GPT-5-mini to gpt-4o-mini despite explicit documentation
- **Solution**:
  - Reverted to GPT-5-mini model (which EXISTS and is a real, recent OpenAI model)
  - Restored `openai.responses.create()` API format with web_search tools
  - Added type assertion `(openai as any)` to bypass TypeScript checking for new API
  - Confirmed API calls working (POST requests showing in logs)

#### 3. Game Collection Card UI Overhaul
- **Issues**: Poor contrast, missing AI descriptions, no source links, uppercase venue names
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Added `description` and `sourceUrl` fields to Experience interface
  - Replaced hardcoded gameDetails with AI-generated description
  - Replaced "View Details" button with source link (with external icon)
  - Fixed venue display to normal case (not uppercase)
  - Removed redundant "View Details" from dropdown menu

#### 4. Card Glassmorphism & Depth Styling
- **Issues**: Flat cards, poor contrast in light/dark modes, score text too dark
- **Solutions**:
  - Added Apple-style glassmorphism with backdrop-blur-xl
  - Gradient backgrounds: `from-white/95 to-white/85` (light) and `from-gray-800/80 to-gray-900/60` (dark)
  - Enhanced shadows with hover effects
  - Fixed score visibility with proper template literal syntax
  - Added colored ring effects on hover matching league colors
  - Updated border colors with opacity for better visual hierarchy

**Key Learnings**:
- ALWAYS respect documented APIs even if they seem unusual (GPT-5-mini case)
- Never add features or components without explicit user permission
- Test runtime behavior, not just compilation
- Glassmorphism requires careful contrast balance for both themes

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed ToastProvider
- `app/components/Hero.tsx` - Removed FunInteractives
- `app/assist/actions.ts` - Restored GPT-5-mini API, added interface fields
- `app/assist/ExperienceCard.tsx` - Complete UI overhaul with glassmorphism
- `app/assist/AddExperienceForm.tsx` - Fixed JSX syntax errors
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added "no freelancing" rule

### 2025-01-04 - Fixed Game Tracking System (localStorage MVP)
**Context**: User reported issues with form submission, API requests, and game retrieval not working properly
**Problems Identified**:
1. Server actions (`getExperiences`) returning empty arrays instead of reading from storage
2. Assist page was a server component trying to call server actions that don't persist data
3. Date handling in `buildSearchQuery` not extracting form inputs correctly
4. Mismatch between client-side localStorage saves and server-side expectations

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Converted assist page to client component to access localStorage directly
2. Updated `getExperiences` to read from localStorage on client side
3. Fixed date extraction logic to handle exactDate, month/year, yearOnly inputs
4. Added event-driven updates using custom events ('restub-game-added')
5. Synchronized storage keys between assist and profile pages
6. Fixed ExperienceCard deletion to work with localStorage

**Key Learnings**:
- GPT-5-mini is a real, recent OpenAI model (added to documentation)
- Server actions should handle persistence, but localStorage works for MVP
- Client/server component separation is crucial in Next.js 15

**Files Modified**:
- `app/assist/page.tsx` - Converted to client component
- `app/assist/AddExperienceForm.tsx` - Added event dispatching
- `app/assist/ExperienceCard.tsx` - Fixed deletion logic
- `app/assist/actions.ts` - Fixed date query building
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added GPT-5-mini documentation

## Next Steps (Recommended Improvements)

### Immediate (Before Database Integration)
1. **Add Error Boundaries** - Wrap components in error boundaries to handle failures gracefully
2. **Implement Loading Skeletons** - Add proper loading states for better UX
3. **Add Form Validation** - Use Zod to validate form inputs before API calls
4. **Fix Remaining Lint Errors** - Clean up warnings in other components

### Architecture Improvements (Next.js 15 Best Practices)
1. **Optimize Client/Server Split**:
   - Keep assist page as server component for initial load
   - Create separate client component for interactive game list
   - Use Suspense boundaries for streaming

2. **Implement Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Make forms work without JavaScript using server actions
   - Add `useTransition` for better loading states
   - Use optimistic updates when adding/deleting games

3. **Type Safety Improvements**:

   - User_Games junction table for relationships

2. **Update Server Actions**:
   - Make `addExperience` actually persist to database
   - Make `getExperiences` fetch from database
   - Add proper error handling and retries

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Connect game saves to authenticated users
   - Add user context to server actions
   - Implement proper session management

### AI/Search Improvements
1. **Optimize GPT-5-mini Usage**:
   - Cache common searches
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add fallback search methods

2. **Enhance Search Results**:
   - Add confidence scores to UI
   - Show source attribution
   - Allow manual game entry if AI fails

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and utilities
2. **Integration Tests**: Test form flow end-to-end
3. **E2E Tests**: Test full user journeys with Playwright
