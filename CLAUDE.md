# Claude Development Preferences

This file contains preferences and guidelines for Claude when working on the Restub project.

## Development Commands

- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack for faster builds)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Type Check**: `npm run lint` (includes TypeScript checking)

## Project Guidelines

### Modern React/Next.js Patterns (React 19 + Next.js 15+)

- **Always use latest React/Next.js documentation** for patterns and best practices
- **Server Actions**: Use server actions for form handling instead of client-side state
- **Server vs Client Components**: Default to server components, only use 'use client' when necessary
- **State Management**: Avoid useState/useEffect when server components can handle the logic
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Forms should work without JavaScript using server actions
- **Performance**: Optimize by keeping as much logic on the server as possible

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow existing component patterns in `app/components/`
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with bright, modern design system
- Maintain consistent gradient themes (vibrant colors, not dark/dreary)
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup
- **ALWAYS use unique keys**: For React lists, always use `crypto.randomUUID()` or combine timestamp + UUID for guaranteed uniqueness. Never rely on Math.random() alone or simple incrementing.

### Component Structure

- Place reusable components in `app/components/`
- Use descriptive component names with PascalCase
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow the existing pattern of Header/Footer layout wrapping

### State Management

- Use React useState for local component state
- Consider the existing form handling patterns
- Maintain data structures consistent with the Experience interface

### Styling Conventions

- Use existing Tailwind utility classes
- Maintain the gradient color scheme: purple-600 to blue-600
- Keep responsive design patterns (sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints)
- Use rounded-2xl for consistent border radius
- Apply hover effects and transitions for interactive elements

### Form Handling

- Use Next.js form actions pattern as established in catalog page
- Include proper validation and required field handling
- Maintain consistent input styling and focus states

## Testing & Quality

- Always run `npm run lint` after making changes
- Ensure responsive design works across breakpoints
- Test form functionality thoroughly
- Verify TypeScript compilation with no errors

## File Organization

- Keep components organized by feature
- Use descriptive file names
- Maintain the existing app directory structure
- Add new pages following the established routing patterns

## Future Development Notes

- Planning to add database integration
- Automatic experience detection feature in development
- Photo attachments will be added later
- Export functionality is planned

## Progress

This section tracks major problems tackled and solutions implemented during development.

### 2025-01-XX - Mobile Button Responsiveness Fix
**Problem**: Button groups were extending off-screen on mobile devices, creating poor UX
**Solution**: Updated all button containers from `flex gap-x` to `flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-x` pattern
**Files Changed**: 
- `app/catalog/AddExperienceForm.tsx` (3 button groups)
- `app/catalog/ExperienceCard.tsx` (media upload buttons)  
- `app/profile/page.tsx` (2 button groups)
**Result**: All buttons now stack vertically on mobile and display horizontally on larger screens

### 2025-01-XX - Git Merge Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: Build failing due to unresolved merge conflicts in catalog page
**Solution**: Cleaned up merge conflict markers and duplicate code sections
**Files Changed**: `app/catalog/page.tsx`
**Result**: Build restored, parsing errors eliminated

### 2025-01-XX - ESLint & TypeScript Errors Fixed
**Problem**: Multiple lint warnings and TypeScript errors preventing clean builds
**Solution**: 
- Fixed unescaped apostrophes using `&apos;` HTML entities
- Removed unused variables and functions
- Added proper TypeScript type assertions for DOM manipulation
**Files Changed**: 
- `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/catalog/AddExperienceForm.tsx`, `app/track/page.tsx` (apostrophes)
- `app/profile/page.tsx` (unused variables, dead code removal)
- `app/catalog/AddExperienceForm.tsx` (TypeScript DOM types)
**Result**: Clean lint output, successful TypeScript compilation

### 2025-01-XX - Dark/Light Mode Implementation
**Problem**: No dark mode support, user requested readable dark theme with proper toggle
**Solution**: Implemented complete theme system using React Context + Tailwind CSS v4
**Components Added**:
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Dark mode configuration
- `app/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` - React context for theme management
- `app/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Toggle component with 3 modes (light/dark/system)
**Files Updated**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added ThemeProvider wrapper and dark mode background classes
- `app/components/Header.tsx` - Added theme toggle and dark mode styling
- `app/components/Hero.tsx` - Dark mode text colors
**Features**:
- 3-mode toggle: Light → Dark → System (follows OS preference)
- Persistent localStorage storage
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Mobile and desktop responsive
- Zero hydration issues
**Result**: Full dark/light mode support with beautiful, readable contrast and brand consistency
